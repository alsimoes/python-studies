Python-studies
==============
[Python-studies](https://github.com/alsimoes/python-studies) are a collection of little projects to play and exercise my [python](https://www.python.org/) skills, each simple project has its own goals. My main goal is to better understand some modules and libraries. The majority will be just simple tutorials (I will link then all), but I will try to do my own touch here and there on this journey.

__I love to code, even if this is not my main activity, will always be in my blood.__
